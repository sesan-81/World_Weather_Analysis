Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data

It was used for generation of a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieval of the nearest city, and performance of an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. Besides, I used the city weather data I gathered in this module to retrieve the current weather description for each city using API skills. Finally, creation of a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data was done.

Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map

Input statements were used to retrieve customer weather preferences. These preferences were also used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The destinations were displayed on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map

The Google Directions API were used to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Creation of a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary was done
